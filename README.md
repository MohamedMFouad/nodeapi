Requirements
------------

1.  **CI/CD Pipeline**: A Jenkins pipeline that:

    -   Pulls code from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/amarthakur0/nodejs-api-template)
    -   Runs unit tests
    -   Packages the application into a Docker container
    -   Pushes the container to a registry
    -   Deploys the application to a cloud provider
2.  **Infrastructure as Code**:

    -   Terraform scripts to provision a VPC, EC2 instance, RDS database, security groups, and IAM roles in AWS
3.  **Kubernetes Deployment**:

    -   Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application in a multi-container pod
    -   Set up a service to expose the application
    -   Implement a horizontal pod autoscaler
    -   Create a ConfigMap and a Secret for application configuration
4.  **Monitoring and Logging**:

    -   Docker-compose file for Prometheus and Grafana setup
    -   Prometheus configuration to scrape application metrics
    -   Grafana dashboard for key metrics
    -   ELK stack configuration for centralized logging
5.  **Security Integration**:

    -   Integrate OWASP ZAP into the CI/CD pipeline for security scanning
    -   Implement network policies in Kubernetes to restrict pod-to-pod communication
6.  **Automation Script**:

    -   Python script to perform health checks, rotate database credentials, and back up application data
7.  **Configuration Management**:

    -   Ansible playbook to install and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy, set up SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt, and configure firewall rules
8.  **Multi-Cloud Strategy** (Optional, for advanced candidates):

    -   Terraform scripts to set up similar infrastructure in Azure
    -   Implement a traffic distribution mechanism between AWS and Azure

Setup Instructions
------------------

        -   Run unit tests
        -   Build Docker image
        -   Push Docker image to registry
        -   Deploy to cloud provider
2.  **Jenkinsfile**:

    -   Use the provided `Jenkinsfile` in the repository to configure the pipeline.

### Infrastructure as Code

1.  **Terraform Setup**:
    -   Install Terraform
    -   Configure AWS credentials
    -   Navigate to the `terraform` directory
    -   Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`

### Kubernetes Deployment

1.  **Kubernetes Manifests**:
    -   Apply the provided Kubernetes manifests using `kubectl apply -f <manifest-file>`

### Monitoring and Logging

1.  **Docker Compose**:

    -   Navigate to the `monitoring` directory
    -   Run `docker-compose up -d` to start Prometheus and Grafana
2.  **Prometheus and Grafana Configuration**:

    -   Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application
    -   Import Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics

### Security Integration

1.  **OWASP ZAP Integration**:

    -   Add OWASP ZAP scanning stage to the Jenkins pipeline
2.  **Kubernetes Network Policies**:

    -   Apply the provided network policies using `kubectl apply -f <network-policy-file>`

### Automation Script

1.  **Python Script**:
    -   Ensure Python and required libraries are installed
    -   Run the provided Python script for health checks, credential rotation, and data backup

### Configuration Management

1.  **Ansible Playbook**:
    -   Install Ansible
    -   Run the provided playbook using `ansible-playbook <playbook-file>`

### Multi-Cloud Strategy (Optional, for advanced candidates)

1.  **Terraform for Azure**:
    -   Navigate to the `azure` directory
    -   Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`
    -   Implement traffic distribution mechanism between AWS and Azure

Assumptions and Design Decisions
--------------------------------

-   Assumed that the application and infrastructure are to be deployed in AWS.
-   Chose Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline due to its flexibility and wide adoption.
-   Used Terraform for infrastructure provisioning to ensure reproducibility and scalability.
-   Deployed the application in Kubernetes for better container orchestration and management.
-   Configured Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring.
-   Integrated ELK stack for centralized logging to simplify troubleshooting and log management.
-   Added security scanning and network policies to enhance the security posture of the deployment.

Improvements and Scaling
------------------------

-   **Scalability**: Implement auto-scaling for both the application and underlying infrastructure based on metrics.
-   **High Availability**: Set up multi-region deployments and load balancing for high availability and disaster recovery.
-   **CI/CD Enhancements**: Incorporate advanced CI/CD practices such as blue-green deployments and canary releases.
-   **Security**: Enhance security by implementing advanced threat detection and incident response mechanisms.
-   **Monitoring**: Extend monitoring to include more application-specific metrics and integrate alerting mechanisms.
-   **Logging**: Improve log management by setting up log retention policies and integrating with a log analysis too
